# Pobreli
A script mention to send a daily text with short useful information on the pollen, asthma, and weather.

Still need to pull the other information as well as setup the text messaging side.
Ignore all the commenting out; I am just doing it to test certain parts of the code as I go. Everything above the pollen section works.
